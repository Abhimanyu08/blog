Hi, Welcome here. I am a guy trying to rather ambitiously make some headway in field of artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning. I took some introductory MOOCS
last year (machine learning course and deeplearning.ai specialization on coursera) and my confidence in myself sky rocketed as those courses were not that challenging tbh. But then I was humbled when I picked some scientific papers to read. Honestly speaking, I was terrified when I looked at those mind-numbingly huge mathematical equations. Most of my fear stemmed from my inability to read greek letters out loud. Probability-statistics, calculus and linear algebra are three main fields one needs to be good at if he is attempting to understand the math behind ML algorithms. I was bad at two of those three subjects - linear algebra and probability & statistics. I didn't pay attention to these two courses when I took them in first year of college owing to lack of motivation. A year later, I got interested in finding out how neural networks work and I immediately regretted my past life decisions :)

Also, I am very incompetent in programming. In fact, I wrote my first line of code just two years ago. I get scared of command line and terms like 'version-control'. I flunked the first programming course I took in college (3 years ago) and was so scared of programming that I ran away from it for a year. To be more specific, I couldn't wrap my head around a specific line of program which was 'a = a+2' (yes, I'm that dumb). My brain just couldn't make sense of it and I stopped putting any effort in the course whatsoever. Also I didn't have any ambitions or goals in my life at that point so I thought why would I need these programming skills in the future anyway ? (again a brilliant and prudent life decision)

Being armed with this impressive skillset, I hope now you can figure out why I added the phrase "rather ambitiously". 

I decided to get good at these areas in which I so obviously sucked. For a lazy animal like me, it was too much to balance along with college and life (I sucked in them too hehe). So, I decided to drop out of college (after wasting an obscene amount of money on tuition) and pursue these fields (I am lucky though cause you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of parents in India who would allow their child to do what I did).

To get better at linear algebra I am studying "Linear algebra done right" by Axler and "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by legendary Gilbert Strang.
To get better at P&S, I am studying "All of Statistics" by Larry Wasserman.
There are numerous resources to get better at programming but I try to just build stuff and look up stack overflow or documentations whenever I get stuck. I am trying to read "Introduction to algorithms" by Cormern and writing it's pseudo code in python. 
To better understand Natural language processing I am reading Jacob Eisenstein's NLP notes. 
I have read first two parts of Deep learning book by Goodfellow et. al and made some nice handwritten notes which I am too lazy to upload (but I'll do that soon hopefully maybe).
I would highly recommend fast.ai courses. I have taken deep learning for coders and deep learning from the foundations. It took insanely long time for me to complete them but it was worth it.

All of these resources I have mentioned are freely available on the Internet except Gilbert Strang's book. You can take his freely available lectures on MIT OCW instead which follow the book closely.

Progress feels very slow right now but I try to just enjoy the process and not care about the results (Yes, I am lucky and privileged enought that I can do so). Most of the times though, I get mired in periods of anxiety and self-doubt. 

Once in a while, I torture my dumb brain by reading some other miscellaneous things. Here are some of which I highly recommend.
1. Man's search for meaning by Victor E. Frankl
2. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi 
3. Deep work by Cal Newport
4. What I talk about when I talk about running by Haruki murakami
5. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
