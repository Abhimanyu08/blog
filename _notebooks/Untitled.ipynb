    "## What Is A Random Variable?\n",
    "To make inferences about events and for predictions we need to map events to some real numbers so that we can perform mathematical calculations and methods. A random variable does just that. A random variable is a mapping defined as ${X: \\omega \\rightarrow R}$. Thus ${X}$ is a random variable which maps a particular event in the sample space ${\\Omega}$ to a real number, .for.eg, if we toss a coin two times then our sample space would be ${(H,H),(H,T),(T,T),(T,H)}$ where T and H represent tails and heads respectively. Let's define X as number of heads in single trial of the experiment, then ${X(H,H) = 2}$. Probability that ${P(X=1)}$ is ${P((H,T))}$ + ${P((T,H))}$ = 0.25+0.25. A function that maps each value of X to it's proabability score is called pdf of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables can be continous too. for.eg if we define X as the temperature at a given time on a particular day. Then X can have any real number value from ${0K}$ to ${10^{32}K}$.\n"
