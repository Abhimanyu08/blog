    "Minimizing the Squared Error is the technique anyone uses while tackling a regression problem in which the target is a continuous variable. Let's say we have collected all our input variables in a matrix ${X}$ of shape (m,n) where m is the number of training examples and ${i^{th}}$ row of ${X}$ or ${i^{th}}$ training example is represented by a n dimensional vector ${x_{i}}$. All the target variables are represented by a vector ${Y}$ of length m (each training example has a real number as it's target) and ${i^{th}}$ element of ${Y}$ is denoted by ${y_{i}}$. Our task is to find a vector ${\\hat\\beta}$ of length n such that ${X\\hat\\beta = Y}$. Now this task can simply be solved by saying ${\\hat\\beta = X^{-1}Y}$ but this is the correct answer only in the case when ${X}$ is a squared matrix and ${Y}$ lies in the column space of ${X}$ i.e m =n and Y is simply a weighted sum of columns of ${X}$. If that's not the case ${X\\hat\\beta}$ can never be equal to ${Y}$. All we can hope to do is minimize the distance between the two vectors ${X\\hat\\beta}$ and ${Y}$. The distance we choose to minimize is ${(Y-X\\hat\\beta)^{T}(Y-X\\hat\\beta)}$ which can also be written as ${\\Sigma_{i=1}^{m} \\space (y_{i}-x_{i}^{T}\\hat\\beta)^{2}}$. Let's denote this error by ${\\epsilon}$. Now, if you are like me, you may wonder why don't we simply minimize ${Y - X\\hat\\beta}$ or some other measure of distance. This is perfectly valid question to ask and we are going to explore this in this blog. For now, just remember that ${\\hat\\beta}$ is the value of ${\\beta}$ that minimises the squared error; written mathematically as : ${\\hat\\beta = argmin_{\\beta} \\space(Y-X\\beta)^{T}(Y-X\\beta)}$. \n",

    "Another way of looking at the regression task is that we have m observations ${(x_{1},y_{1}), (x_{2},y_{2}), ..., (x_{m},y_{m})}$ where each ${x_{i}}$ is a n dimensional vector and ${y_{i}}$ is it's corresponding scalar target value. These m data points can be thought of as m random samples from an unknown data distribution ${P(X,Y\\space;\\space\\theta)}$ where ${\\theta_{true}}$ is the parameter of the distribution. If this doesn't make sense let's take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to predict how many goals a soccer player will score in his next season by just looking at the player's age and number of goals he scored in last season. Therefore, our independent variable is random variable ${X = [\\text Age, \\text # of goals \\,scored\\, in\\, last\\, season]}$ and dependent variable is ${Y =}$ number of goals scored in next season where ${0 \\leq Y \\leq 100}$. Messi may be represented by vector ${(33,40)}$ and Ronaldo by ${(34,37)}$. What do you think ${P([18,1], 25)}$ will be? In other words what is the probability that a player aged 18 and having scored just one goal in previous season scores 25 in his next season? We can safely say that this a highly unlikely event since the player is inexperienced and the number of goals he scored in previous season suggests that he may be a defender. In the same way, we would expect ${P([28,40], 32)}$ to be high since the player is at an age when soccer players achieve their peak and is a proven goalscorer and therefore is highly likely to score 32 in next season. Now instead of guessing, we want to construct a probability distribution over random variables ${X}$ and ${Y}$. Once we have such a distribution we can simply plug in age and goals scored in past season of any player and calculate ${P([\\text age,\\text ranking], y\\space ; \\space \\theta_{true})}$ for each ${y}$ in ${(0,100)}$ and report the ${y}$ which gave the highest probability. Unfortunately, we can't know true distribution since for that we would have to collect data from every single active player which can be a lot. But, we can estimate the true distribution. Any distribution is entirely characterised by it's parameters. for eg a Gaussian distribution is characterised by it's mean and variance and is denoted as ${N (x; \\mu, \\sigma^{2})}$. If we can estimate the parameters of a distribution, then we're golden. Let's denote the estimate of parameter ${\\theta_{true}}$ as ${\\hat\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct such estimate of a distribution we collect the age and goals scored in previous season of m players and observe them for the next season and note down the number og goals they scored. Let each of these observations be represented by ${(x_{i}, y_{i})}$. We can see that some players may have the same ${x}$ either by virtue of error in data collection or they are of same age and scored the same number of goals in last season. Let's assume every observation is independent of any other observation. Given each ${x_{i}}$ we should predict ${y_{i}}$ and this can only happen when ${P(x_{i}, y_{i}\\space ;\\space \\hat\\theta)}$ is greater than all other ${P(x_{i}, y\\space ; \\space \\hat\\theta)}$ where ${y \\neq y_{i}}$. The quantity ${P(x_{i}, y_{i})}$ is known as likelihood of the observation  ${(x_{i}, y_{i})}$. Since we want likelihood of all the observations to be maximum, we might as well say that we we want the quantity ${P(x_{1}, y_{1})\\cdot P(x_{2}, y_{2})\\cdot P(x_{3}, y_{3}) ... P(x_{m}, y_{m})}$ to be maximum which in short can be written as ${\\Pi_{i=1}^{m}P(x_{i}, y_{i}\\space ; \\space \\theta)}$. Then ${\\hat\\theta}$ will be whatever value of ${\\theta}$ which can achieve this feat.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method of estimating ${\\theta_{true}}$ is called maximum likelihood estimation and obtained ${\\hat\\theta}$ is called maximum likelihood estimate of ${\\theta_{true}}$. Maximum likelihood estimates of true parameters have many desirable properties, most important of which is: As we increase the number of training examples, the probability of estimates being close to true parameter increases. Well, this should ofcourse be true.  What's special about the maximum likelihood estimates is that they do so the fastest of any other type of estimate. In other words, if we are using maximum likelihood estimates to estimate our parameters and someone else is using other methods, then our performance on prediction will improve faster on collecting more training data.\n",
